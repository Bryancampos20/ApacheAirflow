# Apache Airflow HelloWorld DAG

Â¡Hola a todos! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bryan Campos Castro, and I am a computer engineer currently working as a full-stack developer.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates how to create a simple workflow using Apache Airflow. The workflow consists of three tasks: a start task **(Start_task)**, a task that prints "Hello, world!" to the console **(Hello_task)**, and an end task **(End_task)**.

## Requirements

Before running this workflow, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- **Docker**
- **Python**

## How It Works

1. **Task Definition:** In the helloWorld.py script, we define the three tasks (Start_task, Hello_task, End_task) and their relationship.
2. **Default Argument Configuration:** Default arguments for the DAG are configured, including the owner, start date, number of retries, and retry delay.
3. **DAG Creation:** The DAG object named hello_world is created using the default arguments, and the previously defined tasks are added to the DAG.
4. **Task Relationship Definition:** We use the >> operator to define the relationship between tasks. In this case, Start_task is scheduled to run before both Hello_task and End_task.
5. **Execution:** Once the DAG is configured, you can trigger the workflow execution from the Apache Airflow web UI.

## Execution

1. Download the file containing the foundation for running Apache Airflow in Docker from this link: https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow.
2. After installing Apache Airflow in your project by running the following command:
```bash
docker pull puckel/docker-airflow
```
3. Start the containers using the following command:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-LocalExecutor.yml up -d
```
4. This way, you will have Airflow running on port 8080.

## Results


This is the dashboard where you can see the DAG before it is executed.

This is the graphical view where we can see that it executed successfully.

These are the logs for (Hello_task).

Finally, this is the dashboard view after it has executed successfully.

This is a basic example of how we can run a HelloWorld in Apache Airflow.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
